# myntra-e-commerce-app

This project is a simplified version of the Myntra e-commerce platform, built using HTML and CSS to create a visually appealing and functional online shopping experience. It demonstrates the core front-end aspects of an e-commerce platform without requiring backend functionality, making it ideal for learning UI design and front-end development.
